# Tropospheric Chemistry Visualization Tool

Visit the live application at: https://tcvt.netlify.app/

## Scientific Overview

This application provides interactive visualization of tropospheric NO2 and HCHO (formaldehyde) concentrations, key atmospheric pollutants that impact air quality and climate. The app allows users to:

- Explore spatial patterns of pollutant concentrations in 3D
- Compare NO2 and HCHO distributions
- Analyze temporal trends through daily, monthly, and hourly visualizations
- Query specific locations for detailed time-series analysis

### Scientific Significance

**NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide)**:
- Primary pollutant from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes
- Contributes to formation of smog and acid rain
- Health impacts include respiratory inflammation and decreased lung function
- Serves as proxy for human activity patterns and emission sources

**HCHO (Formaldehyde)**:
- Both primary pollutant (industrial emissions) and secondary pollutant (VOC oxidation)
- Indicator of photochemical activity and biogenic emissions
- Important precursor for tropospheric ozone formation
- Associated with respiratory irritation and cancer risk at high concentrations

The combined analysis of these pollutants provides insights into:
- Urban air quality dynamics
- Industrial emission patterns
- Seasonal photochemical processes
- Long-term trends in atmospheric chemistry

## Credit and Acknowledgment

This project is based on Esri's [Sea Surface Temperature](https://github.com/Esri/sea-surface-temperature) visualization tool. We've adapted their codebase and architectural approach to create a similar experience for atmospheric chemistry data. Many thanks to the Esri team for open-sourcing their work, which provided the foundation for this application.

## Application Architecture

The application is built using a modern React framework with ArcGIS JavaScript API integration for 3D visualization. Key components include:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
